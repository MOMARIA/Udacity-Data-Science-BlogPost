## _Udacity Nanodegree Program_

The project is for the [Data Scientist Udacity Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). It consists of picking a dataset, selecting 3 business questions and answer them by analysing the dataset.

## Instructions to Run the Project
You need the following Python packages:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

For the data, you may download them from [Genesis_Destatis](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis//online?operation=table&code=43531-0002&bypass=true&levelindex=1&levelid=1691420297686#abreadcrumb).

## Project Motivation
The key motivations behind this project are the following questions:
1) How has the total electricity consumption changed over time for each industry?
2) Which industry has seen the largest increase or decrease in electricity consumption over the years?
3) Are there trends in the data that suggest certain industries are becoming more energy efficient over time?
